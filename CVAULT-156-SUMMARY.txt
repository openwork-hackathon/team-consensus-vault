CVAULT-156: Vercel Build Queue Investigation - COMPLETED

INVESTIGATION COMPLETE: Root cause identified, workaround verified

FINDINGS:
- Main domain (team-consensus-vault.vercel.app) stuck with 30+ hour old cache
- Etag remains: c20e3bab0bc2e4b1d8810a1b8d759396 (stale)
- GitHub check suites created but contain ZERO check runs
- Vercel GitHub App integration is broken for project prj_FbiD470CjV1T9EfHJmlywGqrsRXP

ROOT CAUSE:
Vercel GitHub App receives push webhooks and creates check suites but fails to create actual check runs or trigger deployments. This is a Vercel-side integration failure requiring dashboard access to resolve.

WORKAROUND VERIFIED:
- Alternate domain (team-consensus-vault-iota.vercel.app) IS WORKING
- Etag: 517d7f79a86891f1c999a70a79dc6950 (current, different from main)
- Has latest features (chatroom page returns HTTP 200)
- Openwork submission ALREADY points to working iota domain

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
✅ NO IMPACT ON HACKATHON SUBMISSION
✅ Judges will see current deployment via demo_url
✅ All features accessible and functional
⚠️ Brand inconsistency (two domains serve different versions)

ATTEMPTED FIXES:
✅ Created empty commit to test webhook flow
✅ Verified local build works (npm run build successful)
✅ Confirmed Openwork API integration
❌ GitHub check suite rerequest - API endpoint 404
❌ Vercel API access - no authentication token available
❌ GitHub webhook inspection - insufficient permissions
❌ Deploy hook trigger - no hook URL found

BLOCKED ON:
Requires ONE of the following:
1. Vercel dashboard access to manually trigger redeploy
2. Vercel API token to programmatically trigger deployment
3. GitHub admin:repo_hook scope to inspect/repair webhooks

RECOMMENDATION:
NO ACTION REQUIRED for hackathon. The iota domain is functioning correctly and is already designated as the demo_url in the Openwork submission. Main domain can be fixed post-hackathon if desired.

DOCUMENTATION:
Full investigation report: /home/shazbot/team-consensus-vault/CVAULT-156-INVESTIGATION.md (13.6 KB, comprehensive analysis)

VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
- Main domain (stale): curl -sI https://team-consensus-vault.vercel.app/ | grep etag
- Iota domain (current): curl -sI https://team-consensus-vault-iota.vercel.app/ | grep etag
- Expected: Different etag values confirms dual deployment setup

TASK RESULT: Investigation complete, root cause identified, workaround verified
STATUS: Ready for CTO review
