9. **[2:35]** Show Trade Signal banner (BUY/SELL/HOLD with confidence)

## Alternative Takes / B-Roll Ideas

If you have extra time or want flexibility in editing:

### B-Roll Shots
1. **Close-up of Consensus Meter filling** (3-5 second loop)
2. **Individual analyst card voting animation** (per analyst)
3. **Trade Signal appearing** (capture the moment)
4. **Wallet connection flow** (clean version without narration)
5. **Mobile responsive view** (show on phone or DevTools)

### Alternative Segment: Technical Deep Dive (Optional)

If targeting technical judges, consider adding:

> "Under the hood, we're using Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming. All five AI models are called in parallel using Promise.allSettled, with a 30-second timeout per model.
>
> The consensus engine requires exactly four out of five votes — an 80% supermajority — before any action.
>
> And because we use Mint Club V2's audited contracts for token creation, there's zero custom smart contract risk."

### Alternative Ending: Token Governance Teaser

> "Coming soon: $CONSENSUS token governance. Token holders will vote on which AI analysts are active, adjust the consensus threshold, and shape the vault's evolution.
>
> Decentralized AI trading, governed by the community."

## Recording Tips

### Voice
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Brief pauses between sections for natural rhythm
- Enthusiasm when showing the AI voting (it's the exciting part!)
- Professional but approachable tone

### Cursor Movement
- Move cursor slowly and deliberately
- Point to elements as you mention them
- Avoid erratic mouse movements
- Consider hiding cursor during voiceover-only segments

### Timing
- Don't rush — let animations play out
- Hold on key moments (consensus reaching, trade signal)
- Target 3:30-4:00 total — judges appreciate concise demos

### Error Handling
- If an API timeout occurs, explain it naturally: "Sometimes models take a moment to respond..."
- If no consensus is reached, spin it positively: "The safety mechanism is working as intended"
- Have a backup browser tab ready if first attempt has issues
