## 🎤 Key Phrases (That Worked Well)

### Opening Hook
> "Have you ever wondered how institutional traders make decisions worth millions of dollars? They don't trust just one analyst. They get consensus from entire teams of experts. We're bringing that same wisdom-of-crowds approach to DeFi — but instead of human analysts... we're using five specialized AI models."

### The Innovation
> "Five different AI architectures. When they agree, that signal is far more reliable than any single model alone."

### Consensus Building
> "Notice the consensus meter filling as each analyst completes their analysis. DeepSeek just finished — 85% confidence, bullish. Now Kimi weighs in — also bullish. Watch the consensus meter at the top. It's calculating agreement across all agents."

### Trade Signal Reveal
> "When consensus reaches 80% or higher, the vault triggers a trade signal. Four out of five agents agree: BUY Bitcoin. That's 84% consensus."

### Security Credibility
> "No custom smart contracts — we're using audited, battle-tested infrastructure."

### The Vision
> "A fully autonomous investment DAO where the wisdom of AI crowds outperforms any single fund manager."

## ⚠️ Phrases to Avoid

❌ "The multi-model consensus engine orchestrates parallel processing across heterogeneous AI architectures."
✅ **Simpler:** "Our consensus system runs five AI models in parallel."

❌ "We're leveraging the Base network's EVM compatibility for seamless Web3 integration."
✅ **Simpler:** "We're deployed on Base network for fast, low-cost transactions."

❌ "The tokenomics of the $OPENWORK token incentivize long-term alignment."
✅ **Simpler:** "$OPENWORK token holders govern the vault."

## 🎬 Critical Timing Notes

### Start Consensus Narration Early
- **Don't wait** for all 5 analysts to complete
- **Start explaining** when 2-3 analysts finish (40-50% consensus)
- **Keep energy up** while waiting for final analysts

### Mouse Movement Speed
- Move **50% slower** than natural
- **Pause 1 second** on buttons before clicking
- **Circle elements** you're highlighting

### Speaking Pace
- **10% slower** than normal conversation
- **Pause 1-2 seconds** between sections
- **Smile while talking** (improves voice warmth)

---

## 🔧 If Things Go Wrong

### Consensus Doesn't Reach 80%
> "Notice the system is being cautious — it won't auto-trade without strong agreement. This risk management is built into the consensus mechanism."

### Wallet Won't Connect
- Skip the connection demo
- Say: "Users connect their Web3 wallet here using RainbowKit"

### You Stumble on Words
- **Pause 2 seconds**
- **Restart the sentence**
- Keep going (you can edit it out later)

### Running Long (Over 4:30)
- Cut intro to 20 seconds
- Shorten tech stack to 30 seconds
- Remove future vision details
