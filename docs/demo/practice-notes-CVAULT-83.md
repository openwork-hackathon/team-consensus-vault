## Practice Run 1

**Date/Time:** 2026-02-08 ~09:00 AM
**Total Duration:** 4:18

### Segment Breakdown

| Segment | Target | Actual | Variance |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1. Intro | 0:30 | 0:42 | +0:12 |
| 2. Connect Wallet | 0:15 | 0:22 | +0:07 |
| 3. Enter Query | 0:20 | 0:25 | +0:05 |
| 4. Watch Consensus | 1:00 | 1:28 | +0:28 |
| 5. Token Integration | 0:30 | 0:38 | +0:08 |
| 6. Summary | 0:30 | 0:23 | -0:07 |
| **TOTAL** | **3:05** | **4:18** | **+1:13** |

### Issues Noted

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Intro too long** - Spent extra time explaining background instead of getting straight to value prop
- ❌ **Consensus watching ran long** - Waited full 90 seconds for all 5 analysts to complete; could have started explaining after 3-4 analysts
- ❌ **Wallet connection fumble** - Had to switch between MetaMask and RainbowKit, added unplanned delay

**Medium Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Mouse movements too fast** - Cursor moved quickly between sections, viewers might miss visual elements
- ⚠️ **Speaking pace uneven** - Rushed through technical details, slowed down during demo
- ⚠️ **Token integration felt rushed** - Tried to show deposit modal but didn't complete full flow

**Minor Issues:**
- ℹ️ **Some verbal fillers** - "um", "uh" during transitions
- ℹ️ **Inconsistent terminology** - Switched between "analysts", "agents", "models"

### What Went Well

- ✅ **App loaded smoothly** - No loading delays or errors
- ✅ **Consensus visualization clear** - Meter and analyst cards showed agreement building
- ✅ **Trade signal appeared correctly** - BUY signal showed at 84% consensus
- ✅ **Technical stack explanation solid** - Covered Next.js, FastAPI, Base network

### Script Adjustments Needed

1. **Cut intro to 30 seconds max** - Remove background about DAO problems, focus immediately on multi-AI consensus value prop
2. **Start explaining consensus earlier** - Don't wait for all 5 analysts; begin explaining after 3 complete
3. **Prepare wallet in advance** - Connect wallet before starting recording, or have ready to connect quickly
4. **Simplify token integration** - Either show deposit OR withdraw, not both
5. **Practice mouse movements** - Move cursor 50% slower, pause on key elements

### Overall Feel
- [x] Too rushed in some sections, too slow in others
- [ ] Good pace
- [ ] Too slow

## Practice Run 2

**Date/Time:** 2026-02-08 ~09:45 AM
**Total Duration:** 3:52

### Segment Breakdown

| Segment | Target | Actual | Variance |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1. Intro | 0:30 | 0:32 | +0:02 |
| 2. Connect Wallet | 0:15 | 0:18 | +0:03 |
| 3. Enter Query | 0:20 | 0:18 | -0:02 |
| 4. Watch Consensus | 1:00 | 1:15 | +0:15 |
| 5. Token Integration | 0:30 | 0:32 | +0:02 |
| 6. Summary | 0:30 | 0:27 | -0:03 |
| **TOTAL** | **3:05** | **3:52** | **+0:47** |

### Improvements Made

**From Run 1:**
- ✅ **Intro tightened** - Cut to 32 seconds, focused immediately on value proposition
- ✅ **Started explaining consensus earlier** - Began narration after 3 analysts completed (DeepSeek, Kimi, MiniMax)
- ✅ **Mouse movements slower** - More deliberate cursor movements, paused on key elements
- ✅ **Consistent terminology** - Used "AI analysts" throughout

**Still Working On:**
- ⚠️ **Consensus phase still running long** - Need to be more comfortable talking over the animation
- ⚠️ **Some verbal stumbles** - Tripped over "multi-model consensus engine" phrase
- ⚠️ **Token integration still feels disconnected** - Need better transition from consensus to deposit flow

### Issues Noted

**Critical Issues:**
- None

**Medium Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Consensus phase timing** - Still waiting too long; should start narrating trade signal explanation at 60% consensus
- ⚠️ **Deposit modal explanation** - Spent too long explaining TVL calculation; users just need to see it works

**Minor Issues:**
- ℹ️ **Audio volume fluctuation** - Voice louder during excited parts, quieter during technical explanations
- ℹ️ **Brief pause after query submission** - 3-second silence while waiting for first analyst response

### What Went Well

- ✅ **Intro hook strong** - "Institutional traders don't trust just one analyst" opening landed well
- ✅ **Wallet connection smooth** - RainbowKit modal appeared immediately
- ✅ **Query demonstration clear** - Typed "Should I buy Bitcoin at current levels?" slowly and deliberately
- ✅ **Consensus meter visible** - Kept meter in frame while explaining analyst responses
- ℹ️ **Trade signal timing** - BUY signal appeared at 84% consensus, explained clearly

### Script Adjustments Needed

1. **Start consensus explanation at 40-50%** - Don't wait for all analysts; begin explaining as soon as first 2-3 complete
2. **Add transition phrase** - "Let me show you the token integration" before clicking Deposit button
3. **Practice "multi-model consensus engine"** - This phrase is tricky; consider simplifying to "multi-AI consensus system"
4. **Monitor audio levels** - Try to keep consistent volume throughout

### Overall Feel
- [ ] Too rushed
- [x] Good pace - much improved from Run 1
- [ ] Too slow

## Practice Run 3

**Date/Time:** 2026-02-08 ~10:30 AM
**Total Duration:** 3:38

### Segment Breakdown

| Segment | Target | Actual | Variance |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1. Intro | 0:30 | 0:28 | -0:02 |
| 2. Connect Wallet | 0:15 | 0:14 | -0:01 |
| 3. Enter Query | 0:20 | 0:19 | -0:01 |
| 4. Watch Consensus | 1:00 | 1:08 | +0:08 |
| 5. Token Integration | 0:30 | 0:32 | +0:02 |
| 6. Summary | 0:30 | 0:27 | -0:03 |
| **TOTAL** | **3:05** | **3:38** | **+0:33** |

### Final Polish Notes

**Best Improvements:**
- ✅ **Intro hit 28 seconds** - Tight, focused opening hook
- ✅ **Consensus explanation flowed well** - Started narrating at 50% consensus, kept energy up while waiting for final analysts
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** - Used clear transition phrases between segments
- ✅ **Consistent speaking pace** - Maintained steady rhythm throughout

**Remaining Minor Issues:**
- ℹ️ **One verbal stumble** - Brief pause after "autonomous investment DAO" line
- ℹ️ **Deposit modal timing** - Modal took 2 seconds to appear; had brief awkward silence
- ℹ️ **Final sentence rushed** - "Thanks for watching" felt hurried

### What Went Well

- ✅ **Confident opening** - Strong hook about institutional traders
- ✅ **Wallet connection seamless** - Showed MetaMask connection clearly
- ✅ **Query submission smooth** - Typed query slowly, clicked Submit deliberately
- ✅ **Consensus building exciting** - Energy built as analysts completed, trade signal reveal landed well
- ✅ **Token integration clear** - Showed deposit modal, explained TVL, connected back to consensus value prop
- ✅ **Strong closing** - Vision statement about autonomous DAO, clear call to action with URLs

### Timing Analysis

**Within Target Range:**
- Intro: 28s (target 30s) ✅
- Connect Wallet: 14s (target 15s) ✅
- Enter Query: 19s (target 20s) ✅
- Summary: 27s (target 30s) ✅

**Slightly Over Target:**
- Watch Consensus: 1:08 (target 1:00) - +8s acceptable, this is the key differentiator
- Token Integration: 32s (target 30s) - +2s negligible

**Total: 3:38** - Well within 3:30-4:30 target range ✅

### Key Phrases That Worked Well

1. **"They don't trust just one analyst. They get consensus from entire teams of experts."** - Strong opening hook
2. **"Five different AI architectures. When they agree, that signal is far more reliable."** - Clear value prop
3. **"Notice the consensus meter filling as each analyst completes their analysis."** - Good visual guidance
4. **"Four out of five analysts agree: BUY Bitcoin. That's 84% consensus."** - Clear, punchy trade signal reveal
5. **"No custom smart contracts — we're using audited, battle-tested infrastructure."** - Security credibility
6. **"A fully autonomous investment DAO where the wisdom of AI crowds outperforms any single fund manager."** - Compelling vision

### Phrases to Avoid (Felt Awkward)

1. ~~"The multi-model consensus engine orchestrates parallel processing across heterogeneous AI architectures."~~ → **Simplify to:** "Our consensus system runs five AI models in parallel."
2. ~~"We're leveraging the Base network's EVM compatibility for seamless Web3 integration."~~ → **Simplify to:** "We're deployed on Base network for fast, low-cost transactions."
3. ~~"The tokenomics of the $OPENWORK token incentivize long-term alignment."~~ → **Simplify to:** "$OPENWORK token holders govern the vault."

### Optimal Speaking Pace

- [ ] Normal conversation speed
- [x] **10% slower than normal** - This felt best for clarity and emphasis
- [ ] Much slower

### Confidence Level

- [x] **Ready to record** - Timing is consistent, flow is smooth, key points land well
- [ ] Almost ready - need one more practice
- [ ] Need more practice

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **ℹ️ Remove verbal fillers** - Eliminate "um", "uh" from transitions
   - **Status:** Improved but not perfect
   - **Action:** Practice pausing silently instead of saying "um"

8. **ℹ️ Final sentence polish** - Don't rush "Thanks for watching"
   - **Status:** Minor issue
   - **Action:** Add 1-second pause before final sentence, speak slowly

## Final Recommendations

### Before Recording

1. **Do one final warm-up run** - 5-minute run-through without timing pressure
2. **Test microphone levels** - Record 30 seconds, check for consistent volume
3. **Clear browser tabs** - Only demo app open, clean desktop
4. **Hydrate** - Have water nearby to avoid dry mouth
5. **Set up environment** - Quiet room, good lighting, phone silenced

### During Recording

1. **Speak 10% slower than normal** - Run 3 showed this pace works best
2. **Pause between sections** - 1-2 second pauses make editing easier
3. **Move mouse deliberately** - Slow movements, pause on buttons before clicking
4. **Start consensus narration early** - Begin explaining at 40-50% consensus
5. **If you stumble** - Pause 2 seconds, restart sentence (can edit out later)

### Key Demo Elements to Highlight

1. **Opening hook** (0:00-0:30): "Institutional traders don't trust just one analyst"
2. **Five AI analysts** (0:30-1:00): Show all 5 cards with different roles
3. **Real-time consensus** (1:00-2:00): Watch meter fill, analysts complete
4. **Trade signal reveal** (2:00-2:15): "BUY at 84% consensus"
