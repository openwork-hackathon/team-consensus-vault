## Verification Commands

To verify files are in the GitHub-linked repository:

```bash
# Confirm git remote
cd ~/team-consensus-vault
git remote -v
# Output: origin  https://github.com/openwork-hackathon/team-consensus-vault.git

# Verify files exist and are committed
ls -lh SKILL.md HEARTBEAT.md README.md
# All files present with substantial size

# Check git status
git status
# Should show files are tracked and potentially uncommitted if just created
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Files created and professionally written
2. ⏭️ Verify files are committed to git (not specified in task, but recommended)
3. ⏭️ Ensure files are pushed to GitHub (for judge visibility)
4. ⏭️ Verify files render correctly on GitHub web interface
5. ⏭️ CTO review and approval (per autonomous mode rules)
