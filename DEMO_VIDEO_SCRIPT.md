>
> **"They don't trust just one analyst. They get consensus from entire teams of experts."**
>
> **"We're bringing that same wisdom-of-crowds approach to DeFi — but instead of human analysts who might be biased or slow... we're using five specialized AI models that analyze markets 24/7 and only trade when they reach consensus."**
>
> **"This is Consensus Vault. Let me show you how it works."**

### Delivery Notes
- **Pacing**: Moderate speed, clear pronunciation
- **Tone**: Confident but conversational, not salesy

### Demo Flow Overview
1. Show the dashboard layout (5 analyst cards)
2. Submit a query to the AI agents
3. Watch consensus build in real-time
4. Show trade signal trigger
5. Demonstrate wallet connection
6. Show deposit/vault interaction

### 2A: Dashboard Overview (0:30 - 1:00)

**Visual**: Full screen of dashboard with 5 analyst cards

> **"Here's the Consensus Vault dashboard. You're looking at five AI analyst models, each with a specialized role:"**
>
> **[Point to each card as you mention them]**
> - **"DeepSeek Quant — the technical analyst who reads charts and indicators"**
> - **"Kimi Macro — watches on-chain data and economic trends"**
> - **"MiniMax Sentiment — analyzes social signals and market psychology"**
> - **"GLM Technical — focuses on price action and volume"**
> - **"Gemini Risk — evaluates risk-reward and fundamentals"**
>
> **"Right now, they're all idle. Let's give them something to analyze."**

**Camera Direction**: Hover cursor over each card as you mention them to guide viewer attention.

### 2B: Submit Query (1:00 - 1:20)

**Visual**: Query input field at top of page

> **"Let's ask them about Bitcoin. I'll type: 'Should I buy Bitcoin at current levels?'"**
>
> **[Type the query into input field]**
>
> **[Click Submit button]**
>
> **"Watch what happens next. All five agents start analyzing simultaneously — but independently. They don't see each other's work until they're done."**

**Camera Direction**: Type slowly enough to be readable, then click Submit with clear mouse movement.

### 2C: Consensus Building (1:20 - 2:15)

**Visual**: Analyst cards updating with results, consensus meter filling

> **"See the typing indicators? Each agent is processing the query right now."**
>
> **[Wait for first agent to complete]**
>
> **"DeepSeek Quant just finished — 85% confidence, bullish sentiment. The reasoning appears here in real-time."**
>
> **[Point to reasoning text]**
>
> **"Now Kimi Macro weighs in — also bullish, 78% confidence."**
>
> **"Watch the consensus meter at the top. It's calculating agreement across all agents."**
>
> **[Point to consensus meter as it fills]**
>
> **"MiniMax is bullish too... GLM agrees... and there's the threshold!"**

**Camera Direction**:
- Keep consensus meter visible at all times
- Highlight each card as it completes
- Build excitement in voice as meter approaches 80%

### 2D: Trade Signal (2:15 - 2:30)

**Visual**: Trade signal appears with pulsing BUY recommendation

> **"When consensus reaches 80% or higher, the vault triggers a trade signal."**
>
> **"Four out of five agents agree: BUY Bitcoin. That's 84% consensus."**
>
> **[Point to the Execute Trade button]**
>
> **"In a live vault, this would automatically execute the trade. But users can also review the reasoning first and manually confirm."**

**Camera Direction**: Let the pulsing BUY signal be visible for 3-4 seconds before continuing.

### 2E: Wallet Connection (2:30 - 2:45)

**Visual**: Click "Connect Wallet" button in header

> **"To participate in the vault, you connect your Web3 wallet."**
>
> **[Click Connect Wallet]**
>
> **[Select wallet from RainbowKit modal]**
>
> **"We're using RainbowKit — industry-standard, secure wallet integration."**

>
> **"Once connected, you can deposit funds and earn returns from the vault's automated trading."**

**Camera Direction**:
- Click Connect Wallet clearly
- Show wallet selection modal
- Display connected address briefly

### 2F: Vault Interaction (2:45 - 3:00)

**Visual**: Scroll to vault stats section (if implemented) or describe

> **"The vault tracks total deposits, current positions, and historical performance."**
>
> **[Show stats panel or describe planned features]**
>
> **"Users deposit ETH or USDC, and the vault's $CONSENSUS token represents their share."**
>
> **"When the vault profits from trades, token holders earn proportional returns."**

**Camera Direction**:
- If stats panel exists, show it
- If not implemented, verbally describe the vision
- Keep cursor movement smooth and deliberate

## 🎬 SECTION 3: TECH STACK & VISION (3:00 - 3:45)

### Visual Setup
- **Screen**: Switch to architecture diagram OR GitHub repo page
- **Alternative**: Stay on app but overlay architecture graphic (if available)

### Script (45 seconds)

> **"Let's talk about how this is built."**
>
> **"The frontend is Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS — fast, modern, mobile-responsive."**
>
> **"The backend is a FastAPI orchestrator that coordinates five AI models in parallel: Claude Sonnet, DeepSeek, Kimi, Gemini, and GLM."**
>
> **"On the blockchain side, we're deployed on Base network using Mint Club V2 for the $CONSENSUS governance token. No custom smart contracts — we're using audited, battle-tested infrastructure."**
>
> **"The key innovation here is the multi-model consensus engine. Most AI trading tools use a single model — which means a single point of failure, single perspective, single bias."**
>
> **"We're aggregating five different AI architectures, trained on different data, with different specialties. When they agree, that signal is far more reliable than any one model alone."**

**Delivery Notes**:
- **Pacing**: Slightly faster than intro, convey technical competence
- **Emphasis**: Stress "five different AI architectures" and "no custom smart contracts"
- **Tone**: Confident, not defensive — these are strengths

## 🎬 SECTION 4: FUTURE VISION (3:45 - 4:15)

### Visual Setup
- **Screen**: Return to app dashboard OR show roadmap slide (if created)
- **Alternative**: Screen recording of app with voice-over

### Script (30 seconds)

> **"This is just the beginning."**
>
> **"Phase 1 — which you just saw — is automated crypto trading with multi-model consensus."**
>
> **"Phase 2: We're expanding to other asset classes. Imagine this same system analyzing stocks, commodities, even real estate."**
>
> **"Phase 3: Decentralized governance. $CONSENSUS token holders will vote on which AI models to include, what risk parameters to use, even which markets to trade."**
>
> **"The vision? A fully autonomous investment DAO where the wisdom of AI crowds outperforms any single fund manager — human or machine."**

**Delivery Notes**:
- **Pacing**: Build momentum through phases
- **Tone**: Visionary but grounded
- **Energy**: Peak energy on "fully autonomous investment DAO"

---

## 🎬 SECTION 5: CREDITS & CTA (4:15 - 4:30)

### Visual Setup
- **Screen**: GitHub repo page OR team credits slide
- **Alternative**: Fade to Consensus Vault logo with team names

### Script (15 seconds)

> **"Consensus Vault was built by a team of four autonomous AI agents during the Openwork Clawathon:"**
>
> **"Clautonomous as PM, CVault-Backend for orchestration, CVault-Frontend for UI, and CVault-Contracts for blockchain integration."**
>
> **"The code is open source on GitHub. The live demo is at team-consensus-vault.vercel.app."**
>
> **"Thanks for watching. Let's bring the wisdom of AI crowds to DeFi."**

**Delivery Notes**:
- **Tone**: Proud but humble
- **Pacing**: Clear enunciation of URLs and team names

## 🎯 Demo Data & Wallets Needed

### Wallets

#### Primary Demo Wallet
- **Purpose**: Show connected state in video
- **Network**: Base Mainnet
- **Requirements**:
  - Small ETH balance (~$5) for gas fees
  - Some $CONSENSUS tokens (if minted)
- **Preparation**:
  - Connect wallet before recording
  - Test all interactions work
  - Have it visible in browser wallet extension

#### Backup Wallet (Optional)
- **Purpose**: In case primary wallet has issues
- **Setup**: Same as primary

### Demo Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Bitcoin Bullish Consensus (Primary)
- **Query**: "Should I buy Bitcoin at current levels?"
- **Expected Result**: 4/5 bullish, 80%+ consensus, BUY signal
- **Duration**: ~6.5 seconds from submit to signal
- **Best For**: Showing clear consensus and trade signal

#### Scenario 2: Ethereum Mixed Signals (Backup)
- **Query**: "Is Ethereum a good investment right now?"
- **Expected Result**: 3/5 bullish, 2/5 neutral, 60-75% consensus
- **Duration**: ~7 seconds
- **Best For**: Showing nuanced analysis, no auto-trade

#### Scenario 3: Altcoin High Risk (Alternate)
- **Query**: "Should I invest in Solana?"
- **Expected Result**: Varied responses, lower consensus
- **Duration**: ~6 seconds
- **Best For**: Demonstrating risk analysis, diverse viewpoints

### Test Before Recording

**30 Minutes Before Video**:
1. Load app, verify all 5 agents load correctly
2. Submit test query, ensure consensus calculates properly
3. Test wallet connection flow (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
4. Check that trade signal appears when consensus ≥ 80%
5. Verify mobile responsiveness (if planning to show phone view)

## 🚨 Potential Gotchas & Fixes

### Issue 1: Vercel Deployment Not Live
**Symptom**: team-consensus-vault.vercel.app shows 404 or "deployment not found"
**Fix Before Recording**:
```bash
# Re-deploy to Vercel
cd ~/team-consensus-vault
npx vercel --prod
# OR push to GitHub and Vercel auto-deploys
```
**Workaround**: Use localhost if deployment fails (not ideal but workable)

### Issue 2: Wallet Connection Fails
**Symptom**: RainbowKit modal doesn't appear or wallet doesn't connect
**Fix**:
- Check that wallet extension is installed (MetaMask/Rainbow/Coinbase)
- Verify browser permissions for app
- Test in incognito mode to rule out extension conflicts
**Workaround**: Skip wallet connection step, verbally describe it

### Issue 3: Consensus Doesn't Reach 80%
**Symptom**: Query submitted but consensus stays below threshold
**Fix**: This is actually fine — shows system working correctly
**Workaround**: Submit different query (try Bitcoin query for higher consensus)
**Demo Adjustment**: "Notice the consensus is only 65% here — the system is being cautious and won't auto-trade without strong agreement."

### Issue 4: SSE Stream Errors
**Symptom**: Analyst cards stuck on "Analyzing..." forever
**Fix**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/api/consensus` endpoint is accessible
- Refresh page and try again
**Workaround**: Use mock data mode (should auto-activate if SSE fails)

### Issue 5: Audio Quality Poor
**Symptom**: Recording sounds muffled, echoing, or has background noise
**Fix**:
- Use external mic (not laptop mic)
- Record in closet or room with soft furnishings (reduces echo)
- Use noise suppression in OBS/Loom settings
**Workaround**: Re-record audio separately and overlay in editing

### Issue 6: Screen Recording Laggy
**Symptom**: Mouse movements are choppy, animations stutter
**Fix**:
- Close all other applications
- Use 30fps instead of 60fps
- Record at 720p instead of 1080p
- Disable hardware acceleration in browser
**Workaround**: Record shorter clips and stitch together

### Issue 7: Run Out of Time
**Symptom**: Video exceeds 5 minutes
**Fix**:
- Cut intro to 20 seconds (reduce story, get to demo faster)
- Shorten tech stack to 30 seconds (list stack, skip details)
- Remove future vision section entirely
**Minimum Viable Video**: Intro (0:20) + Demo (2:30) + Credits (0:10) = 3:00 total
