CVAULT-94: Update README with Token Contract Address

STATUS: BLOCKED - Cannot proceed

BLOCKER:
The CONSENSUS token has not been deployed yet. Token deployment requires human browser interaction with Mint Club V2, which is a prerequisite task (CVAULT-22 or CVAULT-45) that has not been completed.

INVESTIGATION COMPLETED:
✓ Searched entire codebase for contract addresses
✓ Checked all environment files (.env.local, .env.example)
✓ Reviewed TOKEN_INFO.md status (shows "PENDING CREATION")
✓ Checked git history for deployment commits
✓ Verified inbox for deployment notifications

FINDINGS:
- No CONSENSUS token contract address exists in the system
- TOKEN_INFO.md line 18: "Contract Address: TBD (pending deployment)"
- Only existing addresses:
  * $OPENWORK backing token: 0x299c30DD5974BF4D5bFE42C340CA40462816AB07
  * Team wallet: 0x676a8720a302Ad5C17A7632BF48C48e71C41B79C

PREPARATION COMPLETED:
✓ Created CVAULT-94_STATUS.md with full investigation report
✓ Prepared file update templates for 5 files (README, .env files, TOKEN_INFO, wagmi.ts)
✓ Documented verification steps for post-deployment
✓ Updated ACTIVITY_LOG.md with investigation results

NEXT STEPS (requires human):
1. Deploy CONSENSUS token via Mint Club V2 (see TOKEN_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md)
2. Obtain contract address from successful deployment
3. Run ./scripts/post-token-deployment.sh [ADDRESS]
4. Resume CVAULT-94 to update all documentation

ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE (once unblocked): 15-20 minutes

DELIVERABLES:
- CVAULT-94_STATUS.md (2.3 KB) - Complete investigation and blocker documentation
- CVAULT-94_SUMMARY.txt (this file) - Executive summary
- ACTIVITY_LOG.md - Updated with findings
- File update templates ready for immediate use

RESOLUTION:
Task cannot proceed until prerequisite task (token deployment) is completed by human with browser access.
