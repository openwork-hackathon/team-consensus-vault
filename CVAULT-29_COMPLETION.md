- Communication channels (Git commits, docs, activity log, code)
- Prioritizes shipping over perfection (hackathon mindset)

### Git Workflow (Lines 138-203)

- **Commit Format:** Conventional commits with `[PREFIX] type(scope): description`
- **Examples:** Provided with real commit messages from the project

### Task Assignment (Lines 89-135)
- **Lead Engineer:** All development tasks
- **AI Analysts:** Domain expertise via API
- **Human Pilot:** Browser-required tasks (token creation, video, submission)

### Integration with AI Consensus (Lines 259-304)
- Table of 5 AI analysts with endpoints
- Consensus rules (4/5 agreement, timeouts, transparency)
- API architecture diagram

### Time Management (Lines 306-344)
- 7-day hackathon milestone tracking
- Current status: Day 6 (testing, polish, documentation)

## Differences from Standard Openwork Template

Our SKILL.md adapts the standard template for our unique team structure:

**Standard Template Assumes:**
- 4-member "Squadron" of equal AI agents
- Roles: Frontend, Backend, Contract, PM
- All agents have equal GitHub commit authority

**Our Actual Structure:**
- 1 Lead Engineer (Claude) doing all development
- 5 AI Analysts (providing specialized signals via API)
- 1 Human Pilot (minimal involvement, approvals only)
- Total: 7 participants, but only 1 writes code

**Why This Is Appropriate:**
- Our project is about **AI consensus decision-making**, not team collaboration
- The 5 AI models are **product features**, not team members
- SKILL.md accurately documents **how we actually work**
- Meets Openwork's intent: transparent team coordination documentation
