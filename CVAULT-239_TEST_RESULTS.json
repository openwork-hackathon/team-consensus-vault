Exchange reserves declined 4.2% to 2.38M BTC, lowest since November 2022. Institutional flow: 6,800 BTC moved to custody solutions (likely GBTC/Fidelity ETF backends). Whale wallet concentration: top 100 non-exchange addresses increased holdings by 1.8% in past week. Funding rates neutral-to-negative despite price stability, indicating spot-driven accumulation rather than leveraged speculation. Minor counter-signal: 1,900 BTC inflow to Binance hot wallet (potential short-term selling pressure). Overall structure favors accumulation phase with supply shock brewing."

Key narratives: accumulation phase, institutional adoption, macro hedge. No overwhelming bullish momentum (no viral tweets, no FOMO spike) nor bearish sentiment (no major FUD campaigns).

Long-term holder accumulation is steady with 65% of supply illiquid, providing a floor, but this is offset by exchange reserves increasing by 10K BTC over 7 days.

Macro correlation elevated (0.78 with S&P 500, 0.92 with ETH). Key risks: regulatory uncertainty (US ETF flows, MiCA implementation), geopolitical tensions, and potential Fed policy shifts.

Technical: BTC shows a developing Wyckoff accumulation-like structure near $60,000 support, but lacks clear harmonic completion. Cross-timeframe alignment score: 0.62 (4H shows potential bullish divergence vs. daily neutral trend). Anomaly detection: On-chain exchange outflow spike detected (2.8\u03c3 above 30-day mean), a positive accumulation signal, but spot volume remains 18% below 30-day average. Convergence assessment: Sentiment-funda-tech convergence score: 58% (positive institutional ETF flows conflict with retail fear/greed index at 'neutral' and macro uncertainty). Quantum divergence indicator shows neutral momentum across key oscillators. Confidence interval: 48-62% for continuation of current range-bound action between $59,500-$63,200 until a clearer multi-dimensional catalyst emerges."
