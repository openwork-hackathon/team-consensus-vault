CVAULT-131: Build compact AI council votes display for prediction market
=====================================================================

## Task Description
Create src/components/prediction-market/CouncilVotes.tsx - a compact React component displaying AI council votes for the prediction market.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements:
1. Single horizontal row layout showing 5 AI model votes
2. Each model displays: small colored icon, model name, vote indicator, confidence %
3. Vote indicators: BUY = green up arrow (▲), SELL = red down arrow (▼), HOLD = gray dash (—), loading = spinner
4. Below the row: consensus summary (e.g., 'Consensus: 4/5 agree on BUY' or 'No consensus yet')
5. Highlight/emphasize models whose vote matches the entrySignal prop

### Props Interface:
- consensusSnapshot: object containing each model's vote, confidence, and loading state
- entrySignal: 'BUY' | 'SELL' | null - the current entry signal to compare against

### Context:
- Used in the predict page during all phases (Entry, Confirm, Live, Exit)
- Should be compact to fit in the prediction market UI
- Check existing components for styling patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS consistent with the project

## Implementation

### Files Created:
1. `/src/components/prediction-market/CouncilVotes.tsx` - Main component
2. `/src/components/prediction-market/index.ts` - Module exports

### Component Structure:

#### Types Defined:
- `VoteType`: 'BUY' | 'SELL' | 'HOLD' | null
- `ModelVote`: Individual model vote data with modelId, modelName, icon, color, vote, confidence, isLoading
- `ConsensusSnapshot`: Container for all model votes with optional timestamp
- `CouncilVotesProps`: Component props interface

#### Model Definitions (5 AI Models):
1. **DeepSeek** - 🔮 Indigo (#6366f1)
2. **Kimi** - 🌙 Violet (#8b5cf6)
3. **MiniMax** - ⚡ Green (#22c55e)
4. **GLM** - 🧠 Emerald (#10b981)
5. **Gemini** - ♊ Yellow (#eab308)

#### Sub-components:
1. **VoteIndicator**: Displays vote symbol (▲/▼/—) or loading spinner
   - BUY: green up arrow (text-bullish)
   - SELL: red down arrow (text-bearish)
   - HOLD: gray dash (text-neutral)
   - Loading: animated spinner with framer-motion rotation

2. **ModelVoteCard**: Individual model display card
   - Colored icon with border matching model color
   - Model name (truncated if needed)
   - Vote indicator
   - Confidence percentage
   - Highlight styling when vote matches entrySignal

3. **calculateConsensus**: Helper function to determine consensus
   - Counts votes for each option
   - Requires 3/5 agreement for consensus
   - Returns consensus text, hasConsensus flag, consensusVote, agreementCount

#### Main Component Features:
- Header showing "AI Council" and vote count (X/5 voted)
- Horizontal row of 5 model cards with responsive gap sizing
- Consensus summary below with color-coded text:
  - BUY consensus: text-bullish (green)
  - SELL consensus: text-bearish (red)
  - HOLD/no consensus: text-neutral or text-muted-foreground
- Highlighting: Models matching entrySignal get bg-primary/10, ring-1 ring-primary/50, and shadow-sm

### Styling Patterns Used:
- Tailwind CSS classes consistent with project (bg-secondary, text-muted-foreground, etc.)
- Framer Motion for loading spinner animation and initial mount animations
- Custom colors for model icons using inline styles with transparency
- Responsive design with sm: breakpoint for gap sizing
- Accessible with aria-label attributes

### Exports:
- Default export: CouncilVotes component
- Named type exports: CouncilVotesProps, ConsensusSnapshot, ModelVote, VoteType

## Testing Notes:
- Component file syntax validated
- TypeScript interfaces properly defined
- Consistent with existing component patterns (AnalystCard, ConsensusMeter, TradeSignal)
- Uses project-standard styling (bullish/bearish/neutral colors from tailwind.config.ts)

## Deliverables Complete:
✅ CouncilVotes.tsx component created
✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces defined
✅ Component exported correctly
✅ Module index.ts for clean imports
