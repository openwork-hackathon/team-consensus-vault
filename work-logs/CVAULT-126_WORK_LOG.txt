CVAULT-126 - Build prediction market page layout and round status component
================================================================================

COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Updated RoundStatus Component (src/components/prediction-market/RoundStatus.tsx):
   - Phase badge with semantic colors per requirements:
     * SCANNING = yellow (bg-yellow-500/20, text-yellow-500)
     * BETTING_WINDOW = green (text-bullish)
     * POSITION_OPEN = orange (bg-orange-500/20, text-orange-500)
     * SETTLEMENT = purple (bg-purple-500/20, text-purple-500)
   - 6-phase progress bar showing current position in cycle
   - Displays asset name, entry price, and countdown timer (during BETTING_WINDOW)
   - Animated phase transitions with framer-motion
   - Live indicator with pulsing dot
   - Exported RoundStatusProps type for consumers

2. Updated Component Index (src/components/prediction-market/index.ts):
   - Added RoundStatus component export
   - Added RoundStatusProps type export
   - Maintains consistent export pattern with other components

3. Verified Predict Page (src/app/predict/page.tsx):
   - Uses usePredictionMarket hook from src/hooks/
   - Layout sections based on current phase:
     * Round status header (always visible)
     * AI council votes display section
     * Betting panel (shown during BETTING_WINDOW phase)
     * Live P&L tracker (shown during POSITION_OPEN phase)
     * Settlement results (shown during SETTLEMENT phase)
   - Next.js App Router conventions ('use client' directive)
   - ToastContainer for notifications
   - Connection status indicators
   - Expandable "How It Works" section

4. Styling Compliance:
   - Follows existing Tailwind patterns: bg-card, rounded-xl, border-border
   - Uses text-bullish/text-bearish for directional indicators
   - Consistent with globals.css CSS variable definitions
   - Matches existing component patterns in src/components/

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/components/prediction-market/RoundStatus.tsx (updated with semantic colors)
- src/components/prediction-market/index.ts (added RoundStatus exports)

FILES VERIFIED:
- src/app/predict/page.tsx (already implemented, follows requirements)
- src/hooks/usePredictionMarket.ts (already implemented, provides required state/methods)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Phase colors strictly follow CVAULT-126 specifications
- Progress bar shows all 6 phases with active/completed states
- Countdown timer only visible during BETTING_WINDOW phase
- Component uses framer-motion for smooth animations
- Fully typed with TypeScript interfaces

VERIFICATION:
✓ TypeScript compiles without errors
✓ Build passes successfully
✓ RoundStatus component exports properly
✓ Predict page uses correct hook and layout sections
✓ Semantic colors match requirements exactly
✓ Follows existing codebase patterns

STATUS: Ready for CTO review
